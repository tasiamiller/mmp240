      <h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

<p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <q> and what is the use of a book,</q> thought Alice <q> without pictures or conversations? </q></p> 
<p>
So she was considering in her own mind (<small>as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid </small>), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a <b>White Rabbit</b> with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
<p>
    There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <q> Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late! </q> ( <i> when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural</i>); but when the Rabbit <em> actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket </em>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet,for it flashed across her mind that she had <strong>never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it </strong>, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. </p>
