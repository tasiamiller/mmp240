      <p> Hello my name is Tasia Miller. But you guys can call ME Tay since I prefer to be called by my nickname anyway. This is my third semester at Borough of Manhattan Community College, though this is my first year as a Multimedia Programming major. I hope to learn a lot in my remaining time here. My dream is to combine my love for design and my love for coding into something beautiful so that I can live comfortably with my cat Mochi(as seen above). </p>
